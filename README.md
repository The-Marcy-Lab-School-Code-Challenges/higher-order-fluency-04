## Instructions

1. Clone down this assignment to AWS Cloud9. 
2. Code your solution using JavaScript in `index.js`. 
3. **Be sure to run and test your code throughly!**
4. By the end of Code Challenge, **commit and push your changes up to Github**.
5. Using the browser, verify that your solution is in your remote repo on Github.

## Problems 

1. Write a function named `concatStrings` that takes an array of words and returns a sentence (single string) with all the element strings concatenated together
